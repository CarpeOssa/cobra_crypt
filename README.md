# COBRA Crypt

COBRA Crypt is a Python-based file encryption tool paying homage to COBRA, the ruthless cartoon antagonists from *G.I. Joe*. It uses Fernet symmetric encryption and codename-style filename obfuscation to secure filesâ€”with a nostalgic 80s flair. Originally created as part of a systems programming course project, this utility combines serious cryptography with light-hearted theming.

## Features

- Symmetric encryption using the `cryptography` library (Fernet)
- Password-derived encryption key via SHA-256
- Cloaking via `.cobra_` prefix and randomized COBRA codename suffixes
- Decryption support to restore original content and filenames
- ASCII-art banner and themed command-line output
- Hidden "hail" easter egg for dramatic effect

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `cryptography` module

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```


## Usage

### Encrypt a directory
```bash
python cobra_crypt.py encrypt <directory_path>
```
### Decrypt a directory
```bash
python cobra_crypt.py decrypt <directory_path>
```
### Easter Egg
```bash
python cobra_crypt.py hail
```
## Password

You will be prompted for a password. Use the same password for encryption and decryption. If the password is incorrect during decryption, the process will fail gracefully.

### Example
```bash
$ python cobra_crypt.py encrypt ./intel
Enter COBRA clearance password: 
Files encrypted. Surveillance evaded. HAIL COBRA!

$ python cobra_crypt.py decrypt ./intel
Enter COBRA clearance password: 
Decryption complete. Operative safe. COBRA prevails.
```
## How It Works

   - Key Derivation: The password is hashed with SHA-256 and converted to a Fernet-compatible key.

   - Encryption: Files are encrypted with Fernet and overwritten in-place.

   - Filename Obfuscation: Original file names are replaced with .cobra_ plus a random codename.

   - Decryption: The tool scans for stealth files, decrypts them, and restores their original names.
